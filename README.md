This project is a versatile Telegram bot built using the telebot library, aimed at delivering up-to-date weather forecasts for cities around the world. It offers multilingual support, allowing users to switch between English and Russian. The bot interacts with users through commands and inline keyboard buttons, providing a seamless experience for setting preferences and retrieving weather data.

Language Settings: Users can choose their preferred language (English or Russian) via an interactive inline keyboard.

Error Handling: Graceful handling of errors when fetching weather data, ensuring a smooth user experience.
